# Tutorial: Finding Leads

Master the lead discovery system to find potential domain buyers.

## Understanding Lead Discovery

Deep Outbound finds leads by:

1. **Searching** - Running targeted web searches
2. **Discovering** - Finding relevant company websites
3. **Scraping** - Extracting contact information

## The Four Strategies

### Strategy 1: Domain Upgrade

**Best for**: Premium .com domains

This strategy finds companies using "inferior" domain patterns who might want to upgrade:

| Pattern | Example | Why They're Targets |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| Prefixes | getcompany.com | Wanted the .com but it was taken |
| Suffixes | companyhq.com | Same story |
| Alt TLDs | company.io | Usually means .com was unavailable |
| Hyphens | my-company.com | Clearly a compromise |

**Example**: For `weatherrobots.com`, searches for:
- `getweatherrobots.com`
- `weatherrobotsapp.com`
- `weatherrobots.io`
- `weather-robots.com`

**Success rate**: Highest - these companies already want the brand.

### Strategy 2: SEO/PPC Bidders

**Best for**: Keyword-rich domains

Finds companies ranking or advertising for your domain's keywords:

- Companies paying for this traffic
- Organic rankers for these terms
- Anyone trying to acquire keyword traffic

**Example**: For `weatherrobots.com`, searches for:
- "weather robotics software"
- "automated weather systems"
- "weather monitoring robots"

**Success rate**: Good - they're already paying for this traffic.

### Strategy 3: Emerging Startups

**Best for**: Trendy/tech domains

Searches startup directories and news:

- ProductHunt launches
- Crunchbase listings
- Tech news mentions
- Recent funding

**Example**: Searches startup databases for "weather" and "robots" related companies.

**Success rate**: Medium - startups are more likely to buy, but harder to find.

### Strategy 4: Market Leaders

**Best for**: Industry-specific domains

Uses pre-defined mappings to find established players:

- Known companies in the space
- Instant results (no search needed)
- Large budgets

**Success rate**: Lower - established companies usually have good domains.

## Hands-On: Running a Search

### Step 1: Start the Search

1. Go to **Domains**
2. Click ⋮ on your domain
3. Select **Find Leads**
4. Choose **Domain Upgrade**
5. Click **Start Search**

### Step 2: Watch Progress

You'll see:
- Search queries being executed
- Companies appearing as found
- Progress bar moving toward 100%

### Step 3: Review Results

After search completes:
- List of discovered companies
- Website URLs
- Category badges showing how they were found

### Step 4: Select Companies

- Check boxes for companies to scrape
- Use **Select All** for bulk selection
- Add custom URLs if you know specific companies

### Step 5: Scrape for Contacts

Click **Scrape X Sites** to:
- Visit each selected website
- Extract contact information
- Create leads in your database

### Step 6: Monitor Scraping

Watch real-time progress:
- ○ Pending - waiting
- ⟳ Scraping - in progress
- ✓ Done - contacts found
- ✗ Error - failed

### Step 7: Review Results

Summary shows:
- Total leads added
- Leads with phone numbers
- Option to view leads or dismiss

## Advanced Techniques

### Running Multiple Strategies

For comprehensive coverage:

1. Run **Domain Upgrade** first (highest quality)
2. Then **SEO/PPC Bidders** (different angle)
3. Finally **Emerging Startups** (cast wider net)

### Adding Custom URLs

If you know specific companies:

1. Research manually on LinkedIn, etc.
2. Find company website
3. Add URL in "Custom URL" field
4. Include in scrape batch

### Background Jobs

Scraping takes time. Use background jobs:

1. Click minimize (−) button
2. Continue using Deep Outbound
3. Job runs in background
4. Notification when complete

## Troubleshooting

### No Search Results

- Try different strategy
- Domain might be too niche
- Add custom URLs manually

### Scraping Fails

Some sites block scraping:
- Contact forms hide emails
- JavaScript-rendered content
- Anti-bot protection

**Solution**: Try company LinkedIn or social profiles manually.

### Few Contacts Found

- Some sites don't list contacts publicly
- Try corporate websites instead of landing pages
- Check company LinkedIn pages

## Best Practices

### Quality Over Quantity

- Better to scrape 10 high-quality companies than 100 random ones
- Review search results before scraping
- Remove irrelevant companies

### Strategy Selection

| Domain Type | First Strategy | Second Strategy |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Premium .com | Domain Upgrade | SEO/PPC |
| Keyword domain | SEO/PPC | Domain Upgrade |
| Tech domain | Emerging Startups | Domain Upgrade |
| Industry term | Market Leaders | SEO/PPC |

### Follow-Up

After finding leads:
1. Review lead quality
2. Enrich data if needed
3. Create targeted campaign
4. Personalize messaging to their situation
